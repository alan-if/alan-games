# About

The goal of this project to gather into a single centralized repository all the text adventures that were created with ALAN-IF in the course of time.
So far, we've been able to track down 55 adventures created with ALAN-2 and ALAN-3, dating back as far as 1995, but we're aware that the actual number is higher than that if we take into account the demos that were created for the various libraries and extensions.

The idea of creating this project sparkled on the [Alan Google Group], where discussions around the lack of an up-do-date list of all ALAN games lead to the creation of the _[List of ALAN Games on IFDB]_ conversation, which readers might want to refer to for more information.


# Project Status

Currently the repository doesn't host any games; we're still in the preliminary stages of gathering all the assets and deciding how to archive them.

If you wish to participate to the project you should join its [Discussions], where you can share your ideas and proposals.
